# Project Overview
This was my first project after completing a specialization course, designed to apply and showcase my newly acquired skills. It covered a wide range of topics, including exploratory data analysis (EDA), data wrangling, regression analysis, hypothesis testing, statistics, and machine learning. The dataset, provided by Coursera, is a fictional representation of taxi company data, including fare amounts, tips, distances, and more. The final outcome was a multiple linear regression model built to predict fare amounts, serving as a comprehensive demonstration of my learning progress at the time.
